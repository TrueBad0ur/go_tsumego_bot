<h1>sgfcount</h1>
The package <a href="sgfutils.html"><tt>sgfutils</tt></a>
contains a few command line utilities that help working with
SGF files that describe go (igo, weiqi, baduk) games.
It would be nice to also have a simple utility that prints the final score.
Let us call it <tt>sgfcount</tt>.

<h2>Example</h2>
<img src="106.png">
<p>
<pre>
% sgfcount <a href="106.sgf">106.sgf</a> > /dev/null
komi=6.5 bcaptct=6 wcaptct=9 result=W+2.5
B: 73+28=101, W: 77+20=97
for B: 4 minus komi
in reality for B: 4 minus komi
missing B territory: 0 pts
</pre>

This says that <tt>sgfcount</tt> agrees with the <tt>RE</tt> and <tt>KM</tt>
information found in the SGF file. It also produces the above diagram,
showing its opinion about the situation. One can also try GNU Go.

<pre>
% gnugo --score estimate -l 106.sgf
Black wins by 18.1 points
% gnugo --score finish -l 106.sgf 2> /dev/null
Black wins by 37.5 points
Result from file: W+2.5
GNU Go result and result from file are different
% gnugo --score aftermath -l 106.sgf 2> /dev/null
Black wins by 37.5 points
Result from file: W+2.5
GNU Go result and result from file are different
</pre>

Of course the problem here is the black group on the left.
It is dead, but GNU Go doesn't notice.

<h2>Example</h2>
CGoban 3.0 has a built-in score estimator. Let us try.
<p>
<img src="AnCho.png">
<img src="est.png">
<p>
<pre>
% sgfcount <a href="AnCho.sgf">AnCho.sgf</a> > /dev/null
komi=6.5 bcaptct=12 wcaptct=13 result=W+0.5
B: 65+23=88, W: 66+16=82
for B: 6 minus komi
in reality for B: 6 minus komi
missing B territory: 0 pts

% gnugo --score estimate -l AnCho.sgf
White wins by 2.5 points
% gnugo --score finish -l AnCho.sgf 2> /dev/null
White wins by 0.5 points
Result from file: W+0.5
GNU Go result and result from file are identical
</pre>

Success for GNU Go, but the score estimator was wrong about the status of
the upper right hand corner. It was also mistaken about the status of
K19 and N5.

<h2>Example</h2>
<img src="943.png">
<p>
<pre>
% sgfcount -coord <a href="943.sgf">943.sgf</a> > /dev/null
komi=2.75 bcaptct=2 wcaptct=0 result=W+0.25
[Chinese, so full komi=5.5, result=W+0.5]
B: 60+110+13=183, W: 56+109+13=178 (chinese)
for B: 5 minus komi
in reality for B: 5 minus komi
missing B territory: 0 pts

% gnugo --score finish -l 943.sgf 2> /dev/null
Black wins by 0.2 points
Result from file: W+0.2
GNU Go result and result from file are different
</pre>
It looks like GNU Go doesn't automatically assume that counts are in <i>zi</i>
when quarter points are involved, and adding <tt>--chinese-rules</tt>
doesn't help. Replace the 2.75 and 0.25 in the SGF file by 5.5 and 0.5
and try again.
<pre>
% gnugo --score finish -l 943a.sgf 2> /dev/null
White wins by 2.5 points
Result from file: W+0.5
GNU Go result and result from file are different
</pre>
Here the difference is because GNU Go played the ko fight at K19
and made W win it. (Under Chinese rules, whether it is useful or
not to win a ko fight depends on parity and the number of dame.
Capturing a ko is worth 2 points and provides an additional move,
while occupying a dame point is worth 1 point. If the additional
move goes to the opponent because he gets the final move, then the
capture in ko did not help. If one gets the additional move oneself,
the capture in ko did gain 2 points. Finally, if there are no more
dame, then a capture in the last ko is worth 3 points, while the
opponent would get 1 point by filling, so that the final ko fight
in a situation without dame is a fight for 4 points.)
<p>
Is GNU Go right in its assessment that W wins these additional 2 points?
Maybe B has ten threats (F18, O18, G16, C7, B1, H12, K9, R19, O10, T19)
and W seven (B17, B13, L16, N6, M7, L2, G6). But those last two
threats of B are no good since they open up further W threats,
and G16 is not a good threat since it forces W to occupy a dame point.
It may be that GNU Go is right.
<p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
If someone has more estimators to try, tell me.
The above showed successful cases for <tt>sgfcount</tt>,
at least cases where <tt>sgfcount</tt> agreed with human counters,
but there are many failures as well. It is nontrivial to determine
the final score from the final position as usually given in the
game records of professional games, especially for a program like
<tt>sgfcount</tt> that tries to do so by statical analysis of
the final position.
