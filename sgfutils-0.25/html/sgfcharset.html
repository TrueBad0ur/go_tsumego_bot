<h1>sgfutils</h1>
The package <a href="sgfutils.html"><tt>sgfutils</tt></a>
contains a few command line utilities that help working with
SGF files that describe go (igo, weiqi, baduk) games.
This page is about <tt>sgfcharset</tt>.

The program <tt>sgfcharset</tt> reads SGF files and tries to guess
their character set. If desired, the files are converted to UTF-8.
<p>
Guessing the character set of an SGF file is not easy: almost all is ASCII,
and perhaps only very little is written in some local character set.
Strictly speaking, an SGF file does not have a character set.
It is written in ASCII, with text fields in some character set CS
as specified by the <tt>CA[]</tt> property.
But when occurrences of '\' and ']' are escaped, one can get
a '\' in the middle of a multibyte character,
and conceivably the text field is no longer valid CS text after escaping.
<p>
It is quite common to find SGF files with a <tt>CA</tt> field that
does not describe the character set of its text fields.
Maybe the <tt>CA</tt> field was correct originally,
but a general purpose converter will not update it when
it converts the file. That is why <tt>sgfcharset</tt> tries to determine
the character set independently of what the <tt>CA</tt> field, if any, says.
(The standard tells us that the default is Latin-1, i.e. ISO-8859-1,
but I have not met many examples.
Very common are ASCII, UTF-8, GB2312 or GB18030, and SJIS.
Also Big5 and EUC-KR occur often.)
<p>
The standard is not very clear on how escaping is supposed to work
in multibyte characters, and very often one finds unescaped '\'
and ']' bytes that are the second byte of a multibyte character.
Therefore <tt>sgfcharset</tt> will view an unescaped ']' in the input
as termination of a textfield only when that is grammatically possible,
i.e., when the next non-whitespace byte is ';' or '(' or ')'
or '[' or an ASCII letter.
<p>
When invoked without <tt>-toutf8</tt> flag, <tt>sgfcharset</tt>
is informative only, and prints its report to <tt>stdout</tt>.
The options ask for more or less output.
<p>
Options:
<dl>
<dt><tt>-na</tt></dt>
<dd>Don't mention ASCII.</dd>
<dt><tt>-nu</tt></dt>
<dd>Don't mention UTF-8 (implies <tt>-na</tt>).</dd>
<dt><tt>-nok</tt></dt>
<dd>Don't mention cases with one, confirmed, candidate character set
(implies <tt>-na</tt>).</dd>
<dt><tt>-q</tt></dt>
<dd>Be more quiet.</dd>
<dt><tt>-v</tt></dt>
<dd>Be more verbose. With <tt>-v -v</tt>: even more verbose.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
When invoked with the <tt>-toutf8</tt> flag, <tt>sgfcharset</tt>
converts the input files to UTF-8 (and adapts the <tt>CA[]</tt> field).
When reading from <tt>stdin</tt>,
the output goes to <tt>stdout</tt>. When reading from a file <tt>foo.sgf</tt>,
the output is written on <tt>foo.sgf.utf8</tt>.
The character set that is used as starting point for the conversion
is the one specified by the user in the <tt>-from</tt> option,
or, when no such option is given, is the character set specified
in the file in the <tt>CA[]</tt> field, if it seems reasonable, or otherwise
is what <tt>sgfcharset</tt> guesses, if it has a good guess.
If <tt>sgfcharset</tt> is uncertain or has no idea, no conversion is done.
If one is optimistic, one can specify that the files must be overwritten
in place by the converted files. Of course that means that the
original contents is lost.
<p>
Options:
<dl>
<dt><tt>-from CHARSET</tt></dt>
<dd>Don't guess, but convert from CHARSET to UTF-8</dd>
<dt><tt>-replace</tt></dt>
<dd>Don't append <tt>.utf8</tt> to the filename, but replace the
original file by the converted file.</dd>
<dt><tt>-f</tt></dt>
<dd>Force: do not abort, but replace nonunderstood bytes by '?'
(and report the number of such replacements).</dd>
